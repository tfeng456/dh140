# Video: Rachel Levine on using Open Street Maps for humanitarian causes

## Thoughts

Before watching the presentation, I had never really put much thought into the maps I use on a daily basis. I did not realize how much I took them for granted until Rachel showed side by side maps of a region that Missing Maps had worked on. The before map was extremely bare and had little to no detail about the area. I often take for granted the fact that I can find the exact location of a building or a restaurant with a quick tap on my phone. Something like that would be impossible in a region where the area has never been mapped. When Rachel mentioned that companies tend to only invest in maps of regions that will help them gain profits, it became apparent why the Missing Maps Program is so vital. The collective and community-based nature of Missing Maps by the American Red Cross has allowed the initiative to be scaled up in a huge way to lead to great impact. The Red Crossâ€™s widespread network has proved to be extremely helpful in bringing community members together to develop maps for their regions.
