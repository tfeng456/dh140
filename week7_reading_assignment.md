# Week 7 Reading Assignment Response

This week, I had the opportunity to read part of the book, "HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities." In the chapter "Mapping Events/Mapping Social Media" (pages 139-159), I learned about how in Digital Humanities, something that digital humanists often try to aim for is the concept of "participation without condition". Through this idea, digital humanities allows for accessibility to all to tell their story and to contribute to the overall narrative. From the concept, digital humanists have developed the idea of HyperCities, which enables geographic data to be combined with social media posts, which can be contributed by all. What I enjoyed about this chapter is how it not only explored the many amazing possibilities of technology like this, but also the complications that can arise. With social media being so accessible, it not only allows for anyone to contribute their perspective to an event, but it also leads to misinformation being easily amplified and spread globally. In the section on Iran and the use of HyperCities to document the 2009 Election Protests in Tehran, I was able to get a glimpse into an early use of this technology. HyperCities and social media was used to document and spread word about the people's stance at a time when the government was claiming something contradictory. It was very interesting to see how HyperCities were adapted in a early setting during the first "Twitter Revolution".

**Questions for the authors:** How have HyperCities been used after the events have supposedly "ended"? Do tweets and social media posts continue to be collected?
