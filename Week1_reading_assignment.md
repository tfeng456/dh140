## Summary

The authors of the article were inspired by the trend popular on TikTok and YouTube in which people listen to songs from the past and see which ones they recognize. The authors wanted to see which generations would recognize songs from every decade and created a quiz that would test this knowledge. After asking for birthdate, the website classifies you as a Boomer, Gen X, Millennial, or Gen Z. Using the data it collects, the article then explores the data and finds out which songs are uniquely known by a certain generation, which are universally known, and which are gradually forgotten for over time. For example, songs like Billy Jean by Michael Jackson are recognized across all generations. Confessions Part II by Usher seems to be recognized by Milennials the most.

## Reflection

In my reading of the article, I enjoyed the fact that it was interactive and that I myself was contributing to the dataset it was using. Music is something that is so universal and enjoyed by people of all generations. It was great to be able to see what sets generations apart, but also what brings everyone together. I also noticed that the article was created in response to a current trend and was released in a timely manner before the topic became irrelevant. This article was successful in that it was engaging, relevant, suitable for a wide audience, and was not overly technical. The visualizations were visually appealing as well. In my own data science research, I aim to create a project that also has these characteristics.
