## Introduction
This repository consists of materials from the DIGITAL HUMANITIES 140: Coding for Humanities course taught by Professor Yoh Kawano at UCLA. This course focuses on Python and how to use it to work with data in the humanities and social sciences.

## Personal Course Objectives
Through this course, I hope to utilize Python to work meaningfully with data. My research goal in this course is to utilize data to create a project that will help educate and shed light on a social issue. Some project ideas I have include looking into crime, demographics, and resource allocation in the United States.
